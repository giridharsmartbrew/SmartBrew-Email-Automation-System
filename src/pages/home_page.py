        An app password is a 16-digit passcode that gives a less secure app or device permission to access your Google Account. 
        
        To create an app password:
        1. Go to your Google Account security settings
        2. Turn on 2-Step Verification if it's not already on
        3. Select "App passwords" under "Signing in to Google"
        4. Generate a new app password specifically for this application
        
        App passwords are recommended instead of your regular account password when using email automation tools.
